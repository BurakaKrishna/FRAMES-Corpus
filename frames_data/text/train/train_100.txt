SYS|im sorry to tell you this but there seems to be no packages for there either, we have dominican republic if you are interested?|sorry

USR|Is it at least a five star hotel?|request
SYS|Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel|inform
USR|Okay this really sucks, is that all you can offer me?|inform
