USR|Hi|greeting
SYS|Hey :slightly_smiling_face: Would you like to book a trip?|greeting
USR|I need your help to plan the dream vacation for me and my grandson!|inform
USR|My grandson has always wanted to visit Porto Alegre.|inform
SYS|Ok!|request
SYS|Where would you depart from?|request
USR|We're both at Toluca.|inform
SYS|Ok!|confirm
SYS|So am I correct in believing there will be one adult and one child in total?|confirm
USR|You're smart!|affirm
SYS|Great :slightly_smiling_face: I will get searching for you immediately.|request
SYS|Do you have a budget in mind for your trip?|request
USR|Let me know if 3200 will be enough|inform
SYS|And have you got any time constraints for your vacation?|request
SYS|Is there a date you would like to leave?|request
SYS|A date you need to return home by?|request
USR|We can leave any day on or after September 2.|inform
USR|But we have to get back before September 12|inform
SYS|Sadly I can’t find anything from Toluca to Porto for one man and one child that costs less than 3200 dollars… would there perhaps be an alternate destination in mind?|sorry
SYS|Or maybe a higher budget you would be willing to work with?|sorry
USR|I was actually thinking of Toronto...|inform
SYS|Ok!|offer
SYS|You’re in luck - I have ONE package left to Toronto within your parameters, and I think it sounds perfect for you!|offer
SYS|You would depart on September 2nd, and leave Toronto on the eleventh.|offer
SYS|You’d be staying at the 4 star Hotel Eric Perrier, located near a cathedral and just a few short strides from the airport.|offer
SYS|You would be treated to free breakfast throughout your stay and have access to free wifi for the duration of your trip.|offer
SYS|The guest rating is an impressive 8.8/10 and the cost of the package is well within your budget at $2648.63.|offer
USR|And we'll have economy seats I assume?|confirm
SYS|Yes, that’s correct.|affirm
USR|Well, I guess this Toronto package ain't too bad...|switch_frame
SYS|:slightly_smiling_face: Would you like me to book it?|suggest
USR|That's wonderful, please do!|affirm
SYS|Consider it done|inform
USR|Thank you my dear!|thankyou
