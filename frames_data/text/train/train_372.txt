USR|Hi!|inform
USR|I need to find a package that will allow me to get to an internship I've been offered.|inform
USR|There are several cities I could go to and I haven't made up my mind up yet, can you help me compare the options?|inform
SYS|Absolutely.|request
SYS|Where would you be departing from and what cities would you like me to check for packages?|request
USR|I live in Goiania and the first city I'm considering is Kobe.|inform
USR|And it's not a paid internship so I was hoping to spend less than 2000 on flights and accomodation|inform
SYS|Do you have any particular dates you would like to travel on?|request
USR|Ok, I need to be there from August 31st to September 12th.|inform
SYS|would you prefer to stay in Kobe for 4 days or 7 days?|suggest
USR|I need to be there for the entire duration of my internship|inform
SYS|For Kobe, I have packages available well under your budget, but the longest one available is a 7 day package either from Sept 1 to to Sept 7 or Sept 6 to Sept 12|offer
USR|Ok thanks, but that won't work for me.|inform
USR|I guess I can cross Kobe of my list.|inform
USR|How about Detroit?|inform
USR|Do you have anything there for the dates I gave you?|inform
SYS|The longest available package that is within your dates in Detroit is an eleven day package departing on Aug 31st and returning on Sept 10th.|hearmore
SYS|This is about as close as I get to your dates in Detroit.|hearmore
SYS|Would you like me to tell you more about this package?|hearmore
USR|That's too bad!|inform
USR|I think its better if there for the entire span of dates they gave me.|inform
USR|It would make a bad impression if I left a day earlier.|inform
USR|How about Leon?|inform
SYS|For Leon,  the longest package I have available is a nine day package from August 31 to Sept 8.|suggest
SYS|The package that most suits your dates is the package in Detroit.|suggest
USR|Alright, can you tell me more about the detroit one then?|moreinfo
SYS|I apologize but my search results were not the correct ones.|sorry
SYS|I do not have any flights available to Detroit from Goiania.|sorry
USR|Ok, well I guess I'll look elsewhere, thanks anyways!|thankyou
