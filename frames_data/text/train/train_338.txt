USR|Hello.|inform
USR|I am a deeply tormented children’s writer and I need to get away to Lima to write my upcoming book, The Little Engine That Let Everyone Down.|inform
USR|I have a deplorable sales record and so I need to stay under 2000 dollars.|inform
USR|I am leaving from Minneapolis.|inform
SYS|Certainly, how many adults and how many children will be traveling on this trip?|request
USR|I travel alone and my solitude is the source of my suffering.|inform
SYS|That sounds excellent!|request
SYS|Do you have any dates in mind?|request
USR|I care not about the arbitrary constraints of calendars.|inform
SYS|You are in luck!|suggest
SYS|I have a trip from August 31 to September 7, where you would be staying at the Olive Summit Hotel, a picturesque 4-star hotel located near a park.|suggest
SYS|Free wi-fi is included, and the total cost of the trip is 801.13.|suggest
SYS|Should I go ahead and book this trip for you?|suggest
USR|I do not wish to be located near a park and I do not want to have to be exposed to the sounds of joyful youths’ merrymaking.|request_alts
USR|I need more options.|request_alts
SYS|I regret to inform you that all Lima hotels in our database are in close proximity to parks.|suggest
SYS|Would you like me to conduct a search in an alternate destination?|suggest
USR|How miserable.|inform
USR|Yes, please search for Seattle results.|inform
SYS|Certainly!|suggest
SYS|I am pleased to present you with a trip to Seattle from September 6 to 11, where you will be staying at the inimitable Emerald, a 5-star institution located near the airport.|suggest
