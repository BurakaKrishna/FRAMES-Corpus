USR|So Hey, I'm an intern- it's pretty fantastic/exciting.|inform
USR|So anyways I need to go to Monterrey between August 27 and September 15.|inform
USR|What do you have leaving from Stuttgart?|inform
SYS|Will you be travelling alone or with a companion?|request
USR|All alone, and for the first time!|inform
USR|If I wasn't so excited, I would be really nervous.|inform
SYS|Do you need to stay in Monterrey right until the 15th of September?|confirm
USR|My dates are kinda flexible, but I absolute cannot go over a budget of 3100 dollars.|inform
SYS|Is a five day package in Monterrey acceptable for you?|offer
SYS|I have a flight departing on Aug 27 and returning on Aug 30 at the Oriental Peaks Hotel.|offer
SYS|It is a little bit more than what your budget allows for at 3240.72USD but it is a 4-star resort with an excellent client rating and it includes free breakfast, free wifi and free parking.|offer
USR|Hmmm it's a little bit too expensive... they have another location in Kingston, can we see what's available there?|inform
SYS|I have a lot available in Kingston within your travel dates.|inform
SYS|Are there any special amenities you are looking for at the hotel?|inform
USR|Hmmm well this is the first time I book any kind of vacation... Can you tell me what amenities are usually offered?|request
