USR|helllloooo, couple of lovebirds here looking to get away to Burlington for our honeymoon :heart_eyes::smiley_cat::two_women_holding_hands:|greeting
SYS|Hello, I can offer you a deal on a 12-day package in Burlington at the Noble Bazaar Resort.|greeting

SYS|How does that sound?|greeting
USR|we are not in New York :confused: can we leave from Stuttgart?|inform
SYS|I have round-trip packages from Stuttgart running from the 27th to the 31st and from the 18th to the 22nd.|suggest
