SYS|Do you have a set budget in mind?|request
USR|Yes!|inform
USR|3100 is the most I would like to spend so anything under that would be great.|inform
SYS|Sure, I'd recommend a 4 day stay at a 3.0 star hotel near a park.|offer
SYS|6.51It has 3.4/10 guest ratings and offers free wifi.|offer
USR|How much would that cost?|request
SYS|It would be 2037.8.|inform
USR|Okay!|inform
USR|Just curious, do you have anything closer to 3100 for a longer stay, or a better hotel?|inform
SYS|I can get you on business flights with the same package for 2536.77.|offer
SYS|Or I can offer you a 5 day stay at a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city for 2546.97.|offer

SYS|It seems reasonably rated at 6.77/10.|inform
USR|Is the 3 star hotel also in the heart of the city by any chance?|request
SYS|That is correct!|inform
SYS|It also offers free parking and free wifi!|inform
USR|You know what actually?|inform
USR|I think I'll take the 4 day stay in the end.|inform
